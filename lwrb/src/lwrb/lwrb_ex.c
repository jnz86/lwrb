 * \param[in]       btw: Bytes To Write, length
 * \return          Number of bytes written to buffer, will always return btw

 * writes the wrap region if there is more data to write. The r indicator is advanced if w overtakes
 * it. This operation is a read op as well as a write op. For thread-safety mutexes may be desired,
